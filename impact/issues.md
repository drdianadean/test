# Issues

_Issues are problems right now. They could have been a risk that is realised, or completely unexpected. Whatever they are, you are dealing with them now._

_RiskID if present other wise leave blank. This would indicate something completely unexpected_

_All issues should have a ticket in either WRMS, Redmine or GitLab, whatever you are using_
